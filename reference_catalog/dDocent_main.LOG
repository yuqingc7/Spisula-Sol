dDocent detects 24 processors available on this system.
Please enter the maximum number of processors to use for this analysis.

Do you want to quality trim your reads?
Type yes or no and press [ENTER]?

Do you want to perform an assembly?
Type yes or no and press [ENTER].
What type of assembly would you like to perform?  Enter SE for single end, PE for paired-end, RPE for paired-end sequencing for RAD protocols with random shearing, or OL for paired-end sequencing that has substantial overlap.
Then press [ENTER]
Reads will be assembled with Rainbow
CD-HIT will cluster reference sequences by similarity. The -c parameter (% similarity to cluster) may need to be changed for your taxa.
Would you like to enter a new c parameter now? Type yes or no and press [ENTER]
Proceeding with default 0.9 value.
Do you want to map reads?  Type yes or no and press [ENTER]
Mapping will not be performed
Do you want to use FreeBayes to call SNPs?  Please type yes or no and press [ENTER]

At this point, all configuration information has been entered and dDocent may take several hours to run.
It is recommended that you move this script to a background operation and disable terminal input and output.
All data and logfiles will still be recorded.
To do this:
Press control and Z simultaneously
Type 'bg' without the quotes and press enter
Type 'disown -h' again without the quotes and press enter
